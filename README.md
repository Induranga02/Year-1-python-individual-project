# Year-1-python-individual-project
This is my first year Python individual project
The provided code serves as a tool to assess and categorize university module outcomes based on credit values. Here's a brief description of its overall functionality:
This Python program, named progression_outcome(), enables a user to input credits for different outcomes (pass, defer, and fail) for university modules.
The code validates the credit inputs, categorizes the progression outcome of each module, and keeps a count of the various categories, 
including "Progress," "Progress (module trailer)," "Do not progress (module retriever)," and "Exclude."
The code continues processing module outcomes until the user decides to quit or has no more data to enter.
When the user chooses to quit, the program presents a histogram summarizing the counts of each progression outcome category and the total number of outcomes.
This tool provides a quick and automated way to assess and categorize module outcomes, making it useful for tracking academic progress and generating reports on student performance.
